# Data-Analytics-machine-failure-prediction
LaunchED Data Analytics Capstone (June-July 2025). Built 91% accurate Logistic Regression model to predict industrial machine failures from real-time sensor data

Machine Failure Prediction Dashboard
LaunchED Data Analytics Capstone (June-July 2025)

Developed end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict industrial machine failures using real-time sensor data including footfall, temperature, air quality, RPM, VOC levels, current sensors, ultrasonic readings, input pressure, and operating temperature.

Business Problem
Industrial machines generate continuous sensor readings across multiple variables. The challenge is identifying failure patterns before breakdowns occur, enabling predictive maintenance to minimize costly downtime and optimize operational efficiency.

Technical Approach
Exploratory Data Analysis: Created five Tableau dashboards analyzing key relationships:

RPM vs Temperature (mechanical stress patterns)

VOC vs Air Quality (environmental failure triggers)

Current Sensor vs Input Pressure (electrical-mechanical strain)

Ultrasonic Sensor vs Footfall (proximity impact)

Failure-only condition analysis

Machine Learning Model: Built Logistic Regression classifier using Python and Scikit-learn. Implemented stratified train-test split, feature engineering across nine sensor variables, and comprehensive model evaluation.

Key Results
Model successfully identifies failure-prone conditions by learning patterns across sensor combinations. Demonstrates strong ability to distinguish between normal operations and impending failures, supporting proactive maintenance scheduling.
